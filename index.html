    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an experienced Full-Stack Developer with over 12 years of expertise in software delivery, currently pursuing a Master of Artificial Intelligence at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. My passion lies in bridging the gap between AI/ML technologies and real-world systems to solve complex problems.
            <br><br>
            Throughout my career, I have led the development of mission-critical systems for public transportation, education, and government sectors. My technical expertise spans across <strong>ASP.NET</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>AI/ML frameworks</strong>. I am particularly skilled in optimizing workflows, automating processes, and delivering scalable solutions that drive operational efficiency.
            <br><br>
            In my academic journey, I am exploring cutting-edge AI techniques, including <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>, <strong>Evolutionary Algorithms</strong>, and <strong>Genetic Programming</strong>, to solve real-world challenges such as dynamic bus scheduling optimization. My goal is to leverage AI to create smarter, more efficient systems that benefit both organizations and end-users.

                    Developed a hybrid DRL-ES framework to optimize bus schedules using real-time data, reducing passenger waiting times by 20%.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Technical Details:</strong>
                    - Built using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong> for reinforcement learning.
                    - Integrated Evolution Strategies (ES) for initial schedule optimization.
                    - Used real-time data to dynamically adjust bus schedules.
                    - Achieved significant improvements in fleet efficiency and passenger satisfaction.
